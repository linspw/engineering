# Introduction to Data Structures


## Definition and importance of data structures.

Data Structures are the fundamental formats to organize, manage and store data in a computer system. They provide a means to efficiently handle data and perform various operations on it. Data structures are crucial in computer science, because they serve as essential abstractions for organizing and manipulating information within computer programs.


## Basic operations on data structures (insertion, deletion, searching)

There are several fundamental operations that can be applied to many data structures, including insertion, deletion, and searching.

### Insertion

The insertion allows the data structure to be populated with some existing data. Which can be used to be part of infinite operations.

### Deletion

The deletions allows to remove elements or values from a data structure. This operation is crucial for maintaining the desired behavior and integrity of the structure.

### Searching

The search is the process of locating a specific elements or values within a data structure. to find values in the data structure. It enables various operations that rely on accessing and retrieving data efficiently.
